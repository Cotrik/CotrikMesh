</ul>
<p>Further new features and enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>(#12) Iterative solvers: Added convenience overloads such that types from the C++ STL can be passed directly.</li>

<li>(#123) Iterative solvers: Added option to specify an absolute tolerance. Thanks to Andreas Rost for the suggestion.</li>
<li>(#126) prod: It is now possible to directly pass expressions as parameters, e.g. A = prod(B + C, 2 * D);</li>
<li>(#127) sum: Added convenience overload for computing sums of vectors as well as row- and column-sums of dense matrices.</li>

<h2>Version 1.5.x</h2>
<h3>Version 1.5.2</h3>
<p>While the work for the upcoming 1.6.0 release is in full progress, this maintenance release fixes a couple of bugs and performance regressions reported to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed compilation problems on Visual Studio for the operations y += prod(A, x) and y -= prod(A, x) with dense matrix A.</li>
<li>Added a better performance profile for NVIDIA Kepler GPUs. For example, this increases the performance of matrix-matrix multiplications to 600 GFLOPs in single precision on a GeForce GTX 680. Thanks to Paul Dufort for bringing this to our attention.</li>
<li>Added support for the operation A = trans(B) for matrices A and B to the scheduler.</li>
<li>Fixed compilation problems in block-ILU preconditioners when passing block boundaries manually.</li>
<li>Ensured compatibility with OpenCL 1.0, which may still be available on older devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.1</h3>
<p>This maintenance release fixes a few nasty bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a memory leak in the OpenCL kernel generator. Thanks to GitHub user dxyzab for spotting this.</li>
<li>Added compatibility of the mixed precision CG implementation with older AMD GPUs. Thanks to Andreas Rost for the input.</li>
<li>Fixed an error when running the QR factorization for matrices with less rows than columns. Thanks to Karol Polko for reporting.</li>
<li>Readded accidentally removed chapters on additional algorithms and structured matrices to the manual. Thanks to Sajjadul Islam for the hint.</li>
<li>Fixed buggy OpenCL kernels for matrix additions and subtractions for column-major matrices. Thanks to Tom Nicholson for reporting.</li>
<li>Fixed an invalid default kernel parameter set for matrix-matrix multiplications on CPUs when using the OpenCL backend. Thanks again to Tom Nicholson.</li>
<li>Corrected a weak check used in two tests. Thanks to Walter Mascarenhas for providing a fix.</li>
<li>Fixed a wrong global work size inside the SPAI preconditioner. Thanks to Andreas Rost.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.0</h3>
<p>This new minor release number update focuses on a more powerful API, and on first steps in making ViennaCL more accessible from languages other than C++. In addition to many internal improvements both in terms of performance and flexibility, the following changes are visible to users:</p>
<ul>
<li>API-change: User-provided OpenCL kernels extract their kernels automatically. A call to add_kernel() is now obsolete, hence the function was removed.</li>
<li>API-change: Device class has been extend and supports all informations defined in the OpenCL 1.1 standard through member functions. Duplicate compute_units() and max_work_group_size() have been removed (thanks for Shantanu Agarwal for the input).</li>
<li>API-change: <a class="el" href="namespaceviennacl.html#a10b7f8cf6b8864a7aa196d670481a453" title="Copies a circulant matrix from the std::vector to the OpenCL device (either GPU or multi-core CPU) ...">viennacl::copy()</a> from a ViennaCL object to an object of non-ViennaCL type no longer tries to resize the object accordingly. An assertion is thrown if the sizes are incorrect in order to provide a consistent behavior across many different types.</li>
<li>Datastructure change: Vectors and matrices are now padded with zeros by default, resulting in higher performance particularly for matrix operations. This padding needs to be taken into account when using <a class="el" href="namespaceviennacl.html#aaa5c8726b45bc89a523ca2fa8c42107a">fast_copy()</a>, particularly for matrices.</li>
<li>Fixed problems with CUDA and CMake+CUDA on Visual Studio.</li>
<li>coordinate_matrix&lt;&gt; now also behaves correctly for tiny matrix dimensions.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Version 1.4.0</h3>
<p>The transition from 1.3.x to 1.4.x features the largest number of additions, improvements, and cleanups since the initial release. In particular, host-, OpenCL-, and CUDA-based execution is now supported. OpenCL now needs to be enabled explicitly! New features and feature improvements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added host-based and CUDA-enabled operations on ViennaCL objects. The default is now a host-based execution for reasons of compatibility. Enable OpenCL- or CUDA-based execution by defining the preprocessor constant VIENNACL_WITH_OPENCL and VIENNACL_WITH_CUDA respectively. Note that CUDA-based execution requires the use of nvcc.</li>
<li>Added mixed-precision CG solver (OpenCL-based).</li>
<li>Greatly improved performance of ILU0 and ILUT preconditioners (up to 10-fold). Also fixed a bug in ILUT.</li>
<li>Added initializer types from Boost.uBLAS (unit_vector, zero_vector, scalar_vector, identity_matrix, zero_matrix, scalar_matrix). Thanks to Karsten Ahnert for suggesting the feature.</li>
<li>Added incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditioner.</li>
<li>Added element-wise operations for vectors as available in Boost.uBLAS (element_prod, element_div).</li>
<li>Added restart-after-N-cycles option to BiCGStab.</li>
<li>Added level-scheduling for ILU-preconditioners. Performance strongly depends on matrix pattern.</li>

<li>Improved performance of LU-factorization of dense matrices.</li>
<li>Improved dense matrix-vector multiplication performance (thanks to Philippe Tillet).</li>
<li>Reduced overhead when copying to/from ublas::compressed_matrix.</li>
<li>ViennaCL objects (scalar, vector, etc.) can now be used as global variables (thanks to an anonymous user on the support-mailinglist).</li>
<li>Refurbished OpenCL vector kernels backend. All operations of the type v1 = a v2 @ b v3 with vectors v1, v2, v3 and scalars a and b including += and -= instead of = are now temporary-free. Similarly for matrices.</li>
<li>matrix_range and matrix_slice as well as vector_range and vector_slice can now be used and mixed completely seamlessly with all standard operations except <a class="el" href="namespaceviennacl_1_1linalg.html#a1050039fb153ae8ad818390a30f96bc4" title="LU factorization of a row-major dense matrix. ">lu_factorize()</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when using <a class="el" href="namespaceviennacl.html#a10b7f8cf6b8864a7aa196d670481a453" title="Copies a circulant matrix from the std::vector to the OpenCL device (either GPU or multi-core CPU) ...">copy()</a> with iterators on vector proxy objects.</li>
<li>Final reduction step in <a class="el" href="namespaceviennacl_1_1linalg.html#ab35950c4374eb3be08a03d852508c01a">inner_prod()</a> and norms is now computed on CPU if the result is a CPU scalar.</li>
<li>Reduced kernel launch overhead of simple vector kernels by packing multiple kernel arguments together.</li>
<li>Updated SVD code and added routines for the computation of symmetric eigenvalues using OpenCL.</li>
<li>custom_operation's constructor now support multiple arguments, allowing multiple expression to be packed in the same kernel for improved performances. However, all the datastructures in the multiple operations must have the same size.</li>
<li>Further improvements to the OpenCL kernel generator: Added a repeat feature for generating loops inside a kernel, added element-wise products and division, added support for every one-argument OpenCL function.</li>
<li>The name of the operation is now a mandatory argument of the constructor of custom_operation.</li>
<li>Improved performances of the generated matrix-vector product code.</li>
<li>Updated interfacing code for the Eigen library, now working with Eigen 3.x.y.</li>
<li>Converter in source-release now depends on Boost.filesystem3 instead of Boost.filesystem2, thus requiring Boost 1.44 or above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 1.3.x</h2>
<h3>Version 1.3.1</h3>
<p>The following bugfixes and enhancements have been applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a compilation problem with GCC 4.7 caused by the wrong order of function declarations. Also removed unnecessary indirections and unused variables.</li>
<li>Improved out-of-source build in the src-version (for packagers).</li>

<li>Extended flexibility of submatrix and subvector proxies (ranges, slices).</li>
<li>Block-ILU for compressed_matrix is now applied on the GPU during the solver cycle phase. However, for the moment the implementation file in viennacl/linalg/detail/ilu/opencl block ilu.hpp needs to be included separately in order to avoid an OpenCL dependency for all ILU implementations.</li>
<li>SVD now supports double precision.</li>
<li>Slighly adjusted the interface for NMF. The approximation rank is now specified by the supplied matrices W and H.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with matrix-matrix products if the result matrix is not initialized properly (thanks to Laszlo Marak for finding the issue and a fix).</li>
<li>The operations C += prod(A, B) and C −= prod(A, B) for matrices A, B, and C no longer introduce temporaries if the three matrices are distinct.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.0</h3>
<p>Several new features enter this new minor version release. Some of the experimental features introduced in 1.2.0 keep their experimental state in 1.3.x due to the short time since 1.2.0, with exceptions listed below along with the new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full support for ranges and slices for dense matrices and vectors (no longer experimental)</li>
<li>QR factorization now possible for arbitrary matrix sizes (no longer experimental)</li>
<li>Further improved matrix-matrix multiplication performance for matrix dimensions which are a multiple of 64 (particularly improves performance for NVIDIA GPUs)</li>

<li>Added singular value decomposition in single precision (experimental, contributed by Volodymyr Kysenko)</li>
<li>Two new ILU-preconditioners added: ILU0 (contributed by Evan Bollig) and a block-diagonal ILU preconditioner using either ILUT or ILU0 for each block. Both preconditioners are computed entirely on the CPU.</li>
<li>Automated OpenCL kernel generator based on high-level operation specifications added (many thanks to Philippe Tillet who had a lot of /fun fun fun/ working on this)</li>
<li>Two new sparse matrix types (by Volodymyr Kysenko): ell_matrix for the ELL format and hyb_matrix for a hybrid format (contributed by Volodymyr Kysenko).</li>

</ul>
<h2>Version 1.2.x</h2>
<h3>Version 1.2.1</h3>
<p>The current release mostly provides a few bug fixes for experimental features introduced in 1.2.0. In addition, performance improvements for matrix-matrix multiplications are applied. The main changes (in addition to some internal adjustments) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed problems with double precision on AMD GPUs supporting cl_amd_fp64 instead of cl_khr_fp64 (thanks to Sylvain R.)</li>
<li>Considerable improvements in the handling of matrix_range. Added <a class="el" href="namespaceviennacl.html#adc45a895937fe299100e2b235a442748">project()</a> function for convenience (cf. Boost.uBLAS)</li>

<li>Fixed incorrect matrix dimensions obtained with the transfer of non-square sparse Eigen and MTL matrices to ViennaCL objects (thanks to sourceforge.net user ggrocca for pointing at this)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.0</h3>
<p>Many new features from the Google Summer of Code and the IuE Summer of Code enter this release. Due to their complexity, they are for the moment still in experimental state (see the respective chapters for details) and are expected to reach maturity with the 1.3.0 release. Shorter release cycles are planned for the near future.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.1</h3>
<p>This new revision release has a focus on better interaction with other linear algebra libraries. The few known glitches with version 1.1.0 are now removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed compilation problems on MacOS X and OpenCL 1.0 header files due to undefined an preprocessor constant (thanks to Vlad-Andrei Lazar and Evan Bollig for reporting this)</li>
<li>Removed the accidental external linkage for three functions (we appreciate the report by Gordon Stevenson).</li>

</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.0</h3>
<p>A large number of new features and improvements over the 1.0.5 release are now available:</p>
<ul>
<li>The completely rewritten OpenCL back-end allows for multiple contexts, multiple devices and even to wrap existing OpenCL resources into ViennaCL objects. A tutorial demonstrates the new functionality. Thanks to Josip Basic for pushing us into that direction.</li>
<li>The tutorials are now named according to their purpose.</li>
<li>The dense matrix type now supports both row-major and column-major storage.</li>
<li>Dense and sparse matrix types now now be filled using STL-emulated types (std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt;NumericT&gt; &gt; and std::vector&lt; std::map&lt; unsigned int, NumericT&gt; &gt;)</li>
<li>BLAS level 3 functionality is now complete. We are very happy with the general out-of-the-box performance of matrix-matrix-products, even though it cannot beat the extremely tuned implementations tailored to certain matrix sizes on a particular device yet.</li>
<li>An automated performance tuning environment allows an optimization of the kernel parameters for the library user's machine. Best parameters can be obtained from a tuning run and stored in a XML file and read at program startup using pugixml.</li>
<li>Two new preconditioners are now included: A Jacobi preconditioner and a row-scaling preconditioner. In contrast to ILUT, they are applied on the OpenCL device directly.</li>
<li>Clean compilation of all examples under Visual Studio 2005 (we recommend newer compilers though...).</li>
<li>Error handling is now carried out using C++ exceptions.</li>
<li>Matrix Market now uses index base 1 per default (thanks to Evan Bollig for reporting that)</li>
<li>Improved performance of norm_X kernels.</li>
<li>Iterative solver tags now have consistent constructors: First argument is the relative tolerance, second argument is the maximum number of total iterations. Other arguments depend on the respective solver.</li>
