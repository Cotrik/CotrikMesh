/** \brief Distance function on a triangle mesh.
 *
 * Represents the geodesic distance function \f$\phi: M \rightarrow
 * \mathbb{R}\f$ to a given set \f$\gamma\f$ on a surface \f$M\f$.  The domain
 * \f$M\f$ is represented by a hmTriMesh -- note that no guarantees can be made
 * about the solution unless this mesh is _manifold_ (i.e., every edge
 * contained in at most two triangles; every vertex contained in a single ring
 * of triangles) and _oriented_ (i.e., all triangles specified in a consistent
 * winding order -- either clockwise or counter-clockwise).  The source set
 * is specified by setting values in hmTriDistance::isSource.  Once the
 * distance function has been initialized, it can be rapidly (re-)computed for
 * a new source set \f$\gamma\f$ by calling hmTriDistanceUpdate(); the
 * solution is stored in hmTriDistance::distance. Distance is computed using
 * the method described in Crane, Weischedel, and Wardetzky, _Geodesics in
 * Heat_, [arXiv:1204.6216v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6216) (2012).
